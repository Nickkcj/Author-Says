# Author Says 📚🎨

## Overview

Author Says is a simple Python project that fetches quotes from famous authors and displays them on a graphical interface. Using the `requests` module to retrieve quotes and `tkinter` to build the user interface, users can click a Van Gogh-themed button to see new quotes every time.

---

## Features ✨
- Fetch quotes from an external API using the `requests` module.
- Display quotes dynamically on a `tkinter` canvas.
- Change quotes with each button click.
- Van Gogh-style button adds a fun and artistic touch!

## How It Works 🛠️
1. When the program runs, the main window (created with `tkinter`) is displayed.
2. The user clicks a Van Gogh button, and the program fetches a new quote using an API.
3. The quote is updated in the window.
